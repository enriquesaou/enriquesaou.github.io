Fortune: to feel with certainty that every bad event happens for a good reason.

That is why i say some people are more lucky than others. It is a matter of staying positive. We are rolling dices all the time - try to focus on the good rolls. You will feel luckier that way. You will feel more grateful.


A few days ago, 
- my bike rear light was stolen - that can only happen if you have a bike in the first place.
- I lost my train to work... well, that means:
    * i have a nice workplace to go
    * there is a station close that takes me right to the place i need to. There aren't outbound trains everywhere, so i am thankful for having one
- I was caught in the rain, but that led me to see a full rainbow. The rain eventually dries, but that particular rainbow will stay for a long time in my head


So, yeah: feeling lucky lately. Hope fortune is with you, too.

Cheers.
