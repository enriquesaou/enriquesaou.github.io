With 8 other planets in our Solar System, one may wonder which one is the closest to Earth. At least i sometimes do.

**The most obvious answer is Venus**. Some facts about Venus:
- Venus is the brightest in our night sky (besides the Moon, of course), and it may even cast shadows on Earth's surface under certain conditions. 
- Venus, under the light of our Sun and the sight of our eyes, is beautifully colored yellow.
- Venus atmosphere is the heaviest of all the rocky bodies. It is dangerous, just like its surface, filled with volcanoes, and it is extremely hot.
- Venus is the Roman goddess of beauty, and the V day of the week.

**The most obvious answer is wrong**. Venus is not the closest planet to Earth, even though in certain moments it can be. But overall, the one that remains nearest is Mercury; **it may never be the closest, but it is never too far either**.


Here's some facts about Mercury:
- Mercury is the smallest of the planets in our system, which makes it hard to spot.
- Mercury, under the light of our Sun and the sight of our eyes, is colored grey.
- Mercury atmosphere is very thin and weak; as a result, the surface is scarred with ancient craters.
- Mercury is the Roman god of commerce, eloquence, messages and travelers, but also of thieves. It is the III day of the week.
- And Mercury is the closest planet to Earth.

So, who is Venus, and who is Mercury, to you?
