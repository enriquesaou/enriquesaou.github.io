**So? Don't you have any wishes to make?**
	    
...hmm, just one, but... it's kind of stupid
		    
**Don't say that! Come on, I promise I won't laugh.**
		    
...hmm... if I say my wish... you promise you won't laugh at me?
		    
**Of course I won't laugh!**
		    
Someday, I'd like to climb this mountain we're all buried under  
Standing under the sky, looking at the world all around... that's my wish
		    
  **(Laughter)**
		    
...Hey. You said you wouldn't laugh at it!
	
**Sorry, it's just funny...**  
         **...that's my wish, too**
